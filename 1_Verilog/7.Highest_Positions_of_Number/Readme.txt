This question is quite interesting. I was asked in one of the big product company.
This question really blew my mind when i heard it, but the solution seemed to be simple.
The question is if an 8 bit number is given, find the highest three positions 
of occurances of 1 in the given number. 

Example1 : Given Seq       = 8'b1001_0010
           Expected Output -> 7,4,1
Example2 : Given Seq       = 8'b0011_1000
           Expected Output -> 5,4,3
